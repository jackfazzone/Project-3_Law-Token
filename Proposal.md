## Description
<p>In civil litigation, when a potential plaintiff does not wish, or is not able, to foot the cost of legal services up front, many attorneys will elect to take a share of the possible judgment instead (~30% in many cases) on a contingency basis. In this way, the plaintiff is not required to pay anything if the case is not won. Law Token attempts facilitate third-party investments in these lawsuits, whereby Ether is offered to cover legal and other expenses in the case in exchange for tokenized equity in the judgment, should the case win. We hypothesize that in pooling the risk inherent to contingency payouts, Law Token would permit plaintiffs to secure funding without having to sell as much equity as 30%, a savings in the equity of the ultimate judgment which becomes especially important for cases involving high medical expenses resulting from injury, worker's compensation, and other lawsuits in which a large portion of the ultimate judgment essential to properly compensating the plaintiff.</p>

## Potential Additions

1. Use previous cases to predict total legal expenses and/or likely payment if case is won -- case scoring (machine learning?)<br>
