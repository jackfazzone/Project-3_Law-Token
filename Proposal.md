II. Once value determined in I is reached, mint tokens that represent equity in judgment to attorney and investors
	A. create .py file to execute and record transfers of Law Tokens to investors

III. Once judgment ETH reaches contract, distribute balance according to addresses' respective equity

IV. Bundled equities in numerous cases to further diversify risk and facilitate financing


Future directions:

- Use previous cases to predict total legal expenses and/or likely payment if case is won -- case scoring (machine learning?)

- Transferrable tokens for each case or bundle (market exchange)
	- Nice-looking landing page listing open cases to invest in
